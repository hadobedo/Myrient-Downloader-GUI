# Myrient-Downloader-GUI
GUI that manages the downloading and processing video game ROMs/ISOs from [Myrient Video Game Preservationists](https://myrient.erista.me). Written in Python! 

## Features
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Download ROMs/ISOs from multiple gaming platforms
  - Available platforms are easily extensible via YAML configuration
- **PS3 ISO Decryption & Extraction**: Option to decrypts and extract downloaded PS3 software for use on consoles and/or emulators like RPCS3
- **User-Friendly Setup**: Required binaries are retrieved & set automatically (on Windows)
- **Cross Platform**: Should work across all platforms!

## Quick Start

### Pre-built Releases (Recommended)
1. **[Download the latest release](https://github.com/hadobedo/Myrient-Downloader-GUI/releases/latest) for your platform**
2. **Extract** and **run** the executable
3. _**That's it!**_ File lists/necessary files will be retrieved automatically and stored in `config/`.

### Required files for PS3 processing - Windows
- **Simply launch `Myrient-Downloader-GUI` and you should be prompted to automatically download the required tools from their respective repositories!**
  - Alternatively, you can download the binaries `PS3Dec` and `extractps3iso` from below and manually specify them via `Settings`

### Required files for PS3 processing - Linux
```bash
# Arch Linux (AUR)
yay -S ps3dec-git ps3iso-utils-git

# Or install manually from source repositories
```

## Configuration
### Platform Configuration
The application uses a dynamic YAML-based configuration system located in [`config/myrient_urls.yaml`](config/myrient_urls.yaml), allowing for easy addition of new platforms without changing code.

### Settings Menu
The destination folders of in-progress and completed downloads for each platform can be defined via the Settings menu. Settings are saved to `config/myrientDownloaderGUI.ini`.

## Running from Source

#### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or on Arch Linux:
sudo pacman -S python-aiohttp python-beautifulsoup4 python-pyqt5 python-requests python-yaml python-pycdlib
```

#### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hadobedo/Myrient-Downloader-GUI.git
cd Myrient-Downloader-GUI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python3 ./myrientDownloaderGUI.py
```

## TODO
- Better logging
  - Also add toggle to enable/disable ps3 decryption logs on Windows
- Terminal interface
- Consolidate `myrient_urls.yaml` and `myrientDownloaderGUI.ini` into a single yaml (maybe)
- Improve downloading of filelist `jsons` and `myrient_urls.yaml`, goal is to make user 'more aware' of what's happening
- Add dropdown box/'hardcode' some myrient urls for easier system configuration (maybe)
